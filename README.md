# Pro-Bowl-Analysis

This repo contains the necessary components of our Pro Bowl Analysis project. We used machine learning to understand different aspects of the pro bowl such as important statistics, and whether players were overrated or underrated. The contents are listed in more detail below

## data

This folder contains three files: passing, rushing, and receiving data. These CSVs were constructed using the webscraper available in src, but for convenience they are available here. To use them, just replace the file path in R.

## docs

This folder contains two files: Final_Report and Presentation. The Final_Report is our overall project writeup, containing more details about our project's methodology and results. The presentation contains a more concise and visual version of the writeup.

## src

This folder contains two files: Pro_Bowl_Modeling, and Pro_Bowl_Webscraping. Pro_Bowl_Modeling is our overall project code, where we ran experiments and extracted results available in the writeup. Pro_Bowl_Webscraping has the available resources if you would like to webscrape the data yourself.
